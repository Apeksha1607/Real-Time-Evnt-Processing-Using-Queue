# 🎟️ Event Processing System (Python)

## 📌 Overview
This is a simple **event queue management system** built in Python.  
It allows users to:
- Add events to a queue  
- Process events in **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)** order  
- Display pending events  
- Cancel a specific event  
- Exit the system  

This project demonstrates the use of **queues** for event handling and basic menu-driven programming in Python.
